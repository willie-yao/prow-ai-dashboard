# Orka container analyzer assessment

Status as of July 23, 2026.

The container analyzer tests whether Orka should own lifecycle for the
dashboard's existing `FailureAnalyzer`. It does not use Orka's AI worker,
Provider, or Tool resources. The in-process analyzer remains canonical.

## Prototype evidence

The initial local kind prototype demonstrated:

- One dashboard-owned analyzer in an Orka `type: container` Task.
- The scripted Flatcar benchmark scored 5 of 5 expected diagnosis signals.
- Orka retried a failed analyzer attempt.
- Analyzer and helper workloads stayed on CPU nodes.
- The Task result remained available through Orka's result API.

This proves the basic lifecycle shape. It does not make the path production
ready.

## Production gates

| Gate | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Structured result framing | Implemented in v2 and retained by `dashboard-failure-analyzer-v4` |
| Immutable request and project bundle | Implemented in v3 and retained by `dashboard-failure-analyzer-v4` |
| Persistent cache and private traces | Implemented by `dashboard-failure-analyzer-v4` |
| Clean in-process and container Kimi comparison | Pending |
| Bounded multi-failure load test | Pending |

No supported Helm analysis mode should use the container path until every gate
passes.

## Result contract

Contract v2 emits exactly one dashboard-owned result marker on stdout:

```text
PROW_AI_RESULT_B64:<base64 FailureAnalysisResult JSON>
```

Normal analyzer logs and errors remain on stderr. The parser scans mixed Task
logs for the last valid marker instead of treating the final non-empty line as
JSON. Identical duplicate markers are accepted. Conflicting valid markers are
rejected. Missing markers, malformed base64, oversized payloads, malformed or
unknown JSON fields, and empty summaries are rejected.

The decoded result is limited to 2 MiB. The Orka controller can continue storing
combined pod logs without becoming the owner of the dashboard result schema.

## Bundle contract

Contract v3 creates one immutable Task-scoped ConfigMap whose identity includes
the content-addressed request and consumer project bundle. The bundle contains:

- `FailureAnalysisRequest`
- Sanitized `project.yaml`
- `prompts/system.md`
- Top-level `skills/*.yaml` and `skills/*.yml`
- Schema version, analyzer contract version, and a full content digest

The Task reads the bundle through `env.valueFrom.configMapKeyRef` and receives the
expected digest separately. The analyzer verifies both digests, writes the files
to a private temporary directory, loads the normal dashboard runtime, and removes
the directory after the analysis attempt.

Provider API, endpoint, model, and headers are removed from bundled
`project.yaml`. API, endpoint, and model remain ordinary Task environment values.
The endpoint must be an absolute HTTP(S) URL without userinfo, fragments, or
query parameters other than `api-version`. Credentials remain Secret references.
Bundles with `ai.headers`, YAML merge
keys, anchors, or aliases are rejected until a safe contract exists. The bundle
is limited to 96 KiB so one ConfigMap value stays below the Linux
per-environment-value limit.

The batch lifecycle prunes bundles older than 24 hours once before a Task wave
when their Task is terminal or missing. Per-Task reconciliation creates the
ConfigMap before applying the Task, writes a unique claim and timestamp, then
rechecks that it still owns the claim before Task apply. Batch pruning skips
recent claims and deletes with the resource version it inspected, so a concurrent
claim prevents a stale delete. Failed application attempts leave their bundle for
the bounded batch GC instead of risking deletion under another reconciler.
Existing immutable bundles are verified and preserved across reconciliation
failures. The
result handler binds cleanup to the Task UID observed with the result, rechecks
that the same UID is still terminal, and uses a resource-version delete. A late
cleanup cannot remove a replacement Task's bundle, and later reconciliations do
not recreate the terminal bundle. Orka Task history and durable results remain
available without retaining the private input ConfigMap.
The pipeline ServiceAccount has only create, get, list, patch, and delete access
to ConfigMaps.

## Persistent state contract

Contract v4 adds a dashboard-owned encrypted state marker:

```text
PROW_AI_STATE_B64:<base64 AES-GCM ciphertext>
```

The Task receives a 256-bit state key through a Secret reference. The encrypted
payload contains only the accepted cache entry for that failure and its bounded,
content-free private trace. Orka stores ciphertext and cannot read the cache or
trace. The public `FailureAnalysisResult` marker remains unchanged.

Before a Task is created, the dashboard state store selects at most one relevant
cache entry and includes it in the private immutable bundle. After Task success,
the dashboard decrypts the state marker and merges cache entries by creation time
and traces by their existing backend identity. Cache and trace files retain their
current schemas and atomic writers. A live kind run proved a second Task reused
the first Task's cache without making another model request, and persisted the
private Orka trace through the shared state store.

## Remaining design risks

- Consumers whose request, prompt, and skills exceed 96 KiB need an immutable
  object-storage transport instead of the ConfigMap path.
- Bundle ConfigMaps contain private failure and prompt context, so namespace
  access remains part of the deployment trust boundary.
- Orka adds scheduling and image startup overhead for every failure.
- The container adapter is useful only if operators value Task retry, history,
  placement, cancellation, and durable lifecycle state enough to justify the
  extra control plane.

## Next evaluation

Run the clean in-process and container Kimi comparison, then the bounded
multi-failure load test. Use those results to decide whether to productize the
container lifecycle path or remove Orka analysis.

## Kimi parity result

On July 23, 2026, merged-main in-process and container runs used the same
Flatcar request, fixture, prompt, skills, floors, and
`moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905` model.

| Metric | In-process | Container |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Benchmark signals | 0/5 | 2/5 |
| Runtime | 6m10s | 5m51s |
| Tool calls | 14 | 15 |
| Artifact bytes | 32,927,513 | 12,912,713 |
| Context bytes | 137,759 | 112,534 |

The container run recognized the registered Node and missing providerID but
still missed the required cloud-node-manager API reachability, kube-proxy, and
loopback DNS chain. Lifecycle isolation did not make Kimi's diagnosis acceptable.

## Load result

An isolated kind wave applied five Tasks in 565 ms and completed all five in
11.6 seconds. Every analyzer Job used the CPU node pool and the same local image.
All results and encrypted state deltas parsed, concurrent cache/trace merges
succeeded, and every Task, Job, Pod, ConfigMap, Secret, image, and cluster owned
by the run was removed. Separate cases proved retry and persistent cache reuse.

## Decision

Do not productize Orka failure analysis. The lifecycle works, but robust result,
bundle, persistence, concurrency, RBAC, retention, and encryption contracts make
Orka a second control plane around ordinary dashboard Jobs. Kimi quality remains
below the acceptance bar, and the operational benefits do not justify this
complexity for the current consumers.

Keep the in-process analyzer canonical. Retain Orka fix generation, which is an
independent runtime boundary. Freeze compatibility v6 as already decided, then
remove the frozen analysis mode and container prototype after confirming no
supported deployment depends on them.
