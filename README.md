# prow-ai-dashboard

Reusable engine for AI-powered Prow and TestGrid dashboards. It discovers Prow
jobs, analyzes failures, renders a React dashboard, and can notify maintainers or
open guarded GitHub actions without requiring each project to fork the engine.

> **Active development.** Pin consumers to `@main`, a commit SHA, or an exact
> prerelease until a stable release and moving `v1` alias are published.

## Start here

Run the guided onboarding wizard from the source repository you want to monitor:

```bash
go run github.com/willie-yao/prow-ai-dashboard/backend/cmd/fetcher@latest onboard
```

The wizard detects the current GitHub repository where possible and walks you
through Prow discovery, deployment, AI, and output choices. It validates the
result before writing a small consumer repository.

Continue with [Onboarding a project](docs/onboarding-a-new-project.md). Flagged,
dry-run, pull-request, and non-interactive usage is in the
[onboarding reference](docs/onboarding-reference.md).

An LLM CLI can run the same engine-owned workflow with
`$setup-prow-ai-consumer`. See the
[agent-driven setup guide](docs/agent-onboarding.md).

## Choose a deployment

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Fast evaluation or a public read-only dashboard | [GitHub Actions and Pages](docs/github-pages.md) |
| A private in-cluster model endpoint or persistent shared data | [Kubernetes with Helm](docs/kubernetes.md) |
| Authenticated chat, File Issue, or Mark Resolved | [Kubernetes with Helm](docs/kubernetes.md) |
| No cluster to operate | [GitHub Actions and Pages](docs/github-pages.md) |

Both deployment paths use the dashboard-owned in-process analyzer. It is the
supported and recommended runtime. Pages publishes static JSON and assets.
Kubernetes adds a server for authentication, chat, and guarded actions.

Experimental external runtimes and Fix PR generation are not part of standard
onboarding. Maintainers evaluating them can start from the
[complete documentation map](docs/README.md#experimental-features-and-runtimes).

## What a project owns

A consumer normally contains only:

```text
project.yaml
prompts/system.md
.github/workflows/deploy.yml   # GitHub Pages
# or
deploy/values.yaml             # Kubernetes
```

- **`project.yaml`** identifies jobs, storage, branding, analysis policy, and
  optional features. Start with guided onboarding or the
  [configuration reference](docs/project-configuration.md).
- **`prompts/system.md`** supplies project-specific architecture, artifact, and
  failure knowledge. It is required when AI analysis is enabled.
- **Deployment configuration** supplies infrastructure details such as runner
  selection, model credentials, persistence, and authenticated server settings.

The files under [`configs/example`](configs/example) are references, not a
ready-to-deploy consumer. Replace every placeholder and validate the result with
`onboard doctor`.

## How data flows

```text
Prow job configuration and artifact storage
                  |
            fetcher or worker
                  |
       in-process analysis
                  |
 dashboard.json, jobs/*.json, flakiness.json
                  |
       Pages or the Kubernetes server
                  |
             React dashboard
```

The Kubernetes server serves the same `/data/*.json` contract as Pages and adds
`/api/capabilities` for server-only features.
