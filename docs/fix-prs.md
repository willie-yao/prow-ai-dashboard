# Agent-proposed fix PRs

The dashboard can draft a **minimal code fix** for a systemic recurring failure
and open a **draft pull request** against the source repo. It is **off by
default**, opt-in per project, and heavily guardrailed: draft-only, bounded file
scope, a CLA-signed commit author, and idempotent dedup.

This is the highest-risk automation the engine offers (it writes code to a repo),
so read this whole page before enabling it.

## What it does

After each fetch, for every **systemic** recurring pattern (the same ones
surfaced on the home page) at or above `min_confidence` that carries a concrete
suggested fix, the engine:

1. **Locates** the target file(s) by choosing from the source repo's **real file
   tree** (fetched and keyword-ranked against the failure), so the model can't
   invent a path that doesn't exist.
2. **Fetches** their current content at a pinned commit.
3. Asks the model for **anchored search/replace edits** (a verbatim snippet to
   find and its replacement), and applies each edit only if its anchor matches
   **exactly once** in the file. Anything ambiguous or not found is rejected, so
   a fix is never applied fuzzily.
4. Opens a **draft PR** via fork-and-PR with the change, the rendered diff, and a
   review checklist in the body.

A fix that can't be grounded at any step (no such file, anchor doesn't match,
touches more than `max_files`) is dropped and logged. No partial or speculative
changes are ever pushed.

## Two modes: fork-and-PR vs direct

How the fix branch reaches the source repo depends on whether you can write to
it, controlled by `ai.fix_prs.fork` (default `true`):

- **`fork: true` (default) — fork-and-PR.** For a source repo you **don't** own
  (the usual case: an upstream community repo). The engine forks the repo under
  the token's identity, pushes the branch to that fork, and opens a **cross-fork
  PR** against the source repo.
- **`fork: false` — direct.** For a source repo you **do** own or maintain (e.g.
  a team running the dashboard on its own CI). The engine pushes the branch
  straight to the source repo and opens a **same-repo PR**. No fork involved.

Either way the PR targets the source repo's default branch and is opened as a
draft. The branch is **never** pushed into a repo you don't own.

## Identity, CLA, and the token (read this first)

- **`FIX_TOKEN`** is a **personal access token** of a real contributor. It is
  **not** the Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` (which can't touch a fork elsewhere). Which
  PAT kind you need depends on the mode:
  - **`fork: true` against a repo you don't own** → use a **classic PAT** (scope
    `repo`, or `public_repo` for public-only repos). A **fine-grained PAT cannot
    open a PR against a repo you don't own**, because it can only be granted
    permissions on your own repos.
  - **`fork: false` against a repo you own** (or `fork: true` testing against
    your own fork) → a **fine-grained PAT** works: scope it to that repo with
    **Contents: Read and write** and **Pull requests: Read and write**.
- **CLA / DCO.** CNCF projects (Kubernetes, etc.) run EasyCLA, which checks
  **every commit's author** against a signed CLA and blocks merge otherwise. So:
  - `author_name` / `author_email` **must** be the CLA-signed identity, and the
    email **must** match that GitHub account, or the check reports an "unknown
    commit author".
  - Every commit gets a DCO `Signed-off-by` trailer matching the author
    (required by Kubernetes repos). The engine adds this automatically.
  - A GitHub App / bot identity generally is **not** recognized by EasyCLA;
    use a human contributor's PAT.
- **Prow keeps a human in the loop for free.** A draft PR won't run CI or merge
  without a maintainer's `/ok-to-test`, `/lgtm`, and `/approve`. The engine never
  merges anything.

## Configuration

```yaml
ai:
  fix_prs:
    enabled: true
    # repo:                       # defaults to branding.source_repo
    #   owner: "kubernetes-sigs"
    #   name: "cluster-api-provider-azure"
    author_name: "Jane Maintainer"     # required: CLA-signed identity
    author_email: "jane@example.com"   # required: must match that GitHub account
    # fork: true                  # true (default): fork-and-PR for a repo you don't own;
    #                             # false: direct branch + same-repo PR for a repo you own
    # min_confidence: high        # only systemic patterns at >= this confidence (default high)
    # max_files: 3                # cap files a single fix may touch (default 3)
    # max_new_per_run: 1          # cap fix PRs per fetch (default 1)
    # labels: [ai-proposed-fix]   # labels applied to each PR
    # dry_run: false              # propose without opening a PR (see below)
```

`enabled: true` requires `author_name` and `author_email` (validated at load).
The feature is active only when **all** of `enabled: true`, a non-empty
`FIX_TOKEN`, and a resolved source repo are present; any missing piece is a
no-op, never a deploy failure.

Wire the token into the deploy workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: willie-yao/prow-ai-dashboard/.github/workflows/reusable-deploy.yml@main
    secrets:
      AI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.AI_TOKEN }}
      FIX_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIX_TOKEN }}
```

## Start with dry-run

Before letting it open real PRs, set `dry_run: true`. The engine runs the full
pipeline (locate, fetch, edit, validate) and writes the proposed changes to
`fix_previews.json` in the published data directory (and logs the diffs), but
**opens no PR and forks nothing**. Inspect the previews, confirm the edits look
right and target the correct files, then flip `dry_run` off.

## Guardrails (summary)

- **Opt-in** per project; **draft-only** PRs; never pushes to a protected branch.
- Only **systemic**, at-or-above-`min_confidence` patterns with a concrete fix.
- **Anchored edits**, exact-match-once or rejected; bounded by `max_files`.
- Dedicated **`FIX_TOKEN`** with a CLA-signed author and DCO sign-off.
- **Idempotent**: a hidden marker keyed by job + root-cause fingerprint (local
  state plus an open-PR search) means a pattern is never proposed twice, and a
  different cause on the same job is proposed separately.
- **`max_new_per_run`** caps PRs per fetch.

## Known limitations

- **File mode.** Edited files are committed as regular files (`100644`). If a fix
  were to edit an executable script, the PR would drop the executable bit; the
  change is visible in the draft diff for a reviewer to catch. Fix targets are
  typically YAML/templates, so this is rare.
- **Concurrency.** Dedup (local state + an open-PR search) is not atomic, so two
  overlapping deploys could both propose the same fix. Scheduled deploys are
  normally serialized; add a workflow `concurrency:` group if you run them in
  parallel.
- **First fork.** Creating a brand-new fork is asynchronous; on the very first
  run for a never-forked repo the commit step may fail while the fork populates.
  The next run (fork now exists) succeeds.

## Relationship to the other features

This builds on the same pattern analysis that drives the home-page recurring
patterns, the auto-filed issues ([github-issues.md](github-issues.md)), and the
skill suggestions ([skills.md](skills.md#auto-suggesting-recipes)). Issues and
skill suggestions act on **your** repos; fix PRs are the only feature that writes
to the **source** repo, which is why the identity and CLA requirements are
stricter.
