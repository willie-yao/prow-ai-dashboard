# Running the dashboard Kubernetes-native

The engine ships two coequal deploy paths from one codebase. This guide covers
the **Kubernetes-native** path: the dashboard runs in-cluster next to your
inference stack, with the fetch as a worker (or CronJob) and a small server
serving the dashboard from a shared volume. The other path is the static
[GitHub Actions + Pages](../README.md) deploy, where the fetcher writes JSON,
Actions builds the SPA, and Pages serves it.

Server mode is a strict superset of the static contract. The server exposes the
same `/data/*.json` files the SPA already reads, adds `/api/capabilities` so the
frontend can discover server-only features, and serves the SPA itself. See
[server.md](server.md) for the endpoint reference and the capability seam. The
static Pages path keeps working unchanged.

## Why run in-cluster

- The fetcher's model calls stay inside the cluster: low latency, no egress, and
  no need to expose a private endpoint publicly.
- The AI cache and output live on a shared volume, so warm caches survive across
  fetch runs and the server always serves the latest completed fetch.
- It is the foundation for stateful, interactive features added later.

## Architecture

```
CronJob (fetcher)  --writes-->  RWX volume  <--reads--  Deployment (server)
   -project-dir=/config           /data                   -data-dir=/data
   -out=/data                  data + ai_cache.json        -static-dir=/app/web
                                                                |
                                                             Service / Ingress
```

One image carries both binaries and the built SPA. The fetcher and the server
mount the same `ReadWriteMany` volume: the fetcher writes `dashboard.json`,
`jobs/*.json`, and the rest (plus its `ai_cache.json`), and the server reads
them. `ReadWriteMany` is required so both pods can mount the claim at once.

## Fetch modes: cron vs watch

The chart produces data in one of two modes, set by `mode`. Both keep exactly
one writer to the shared volume.

- `mode: watch` (default): a continuous worker Deployment refreshes data on a
  short interval, reusing a cached job list so it skips job rediscovery, and does
  a full pass (rediscover jobs, run notifications and issue and PR side effects)
  on a longer interval. Newly finished builds are analyzed within the watch
  interval instead of waiting for the next cron tick. The worker uses a
  `Recreate` rollout so an update never runs two writers at once.
- `mode: cron`: the fetcher runs as a scheduled CronJob. Portable, and the same
  binary the GitHub Actions + Pages path uses.

Watch mode detects new builds by listing each job's builds in the artifact
store and reusing the on-disk cache, the same mechanism a normal fetch uses. It
needs no TestGrid API, no Prow or bucket ownership, and no pub/sub.

The worker must be the only writer to the shared volume. Do not run the CronJob
or a manual `fetch-now` Job alongside it, and do not point a second release at
the same `existingClaim`. A `Recreate` rollout keeps a single worker across
updates, and Helm-managed config or secret changes trigger a rollout
automatically.

## Analysis backend: in-process or Orka

The `analysis` value selects how failing tests are analyzed. Both backends write
the same `jobs/*.json`, so the server, the SPA, and the `/data` contract are
identical either way.

- `analysis: inprocess` (default): the worker or CronJob runs the engine's
  in-process agentic loop, governed by `ai.enabled`. It is self-contained, so a
  fresh `helm install` works with no extra components.
- `analysis: orka` (recommended for the Kubernetes-native path): the fetch step
  writes the dashboard skeleton only, and the [Orka](../experimental/orka/)
  pipeline runs the analysis as Kubernetes-native Tasks alongside your inference
  stack, with native retries, per-Task observability, and a path to agent-runtime
  remediation. This is the preferred backend once you operate an in-cluster
  model, because the analysis then runs as first-class cluster workloads next to
  it rather than inside the fetch process.

Orka mode requires `mode: cron` and assumes Orka, the artifact tool shim, a
Provider, and the patched ai-worker image are already installed in the cluster.
The chart deploys the analysis pipeline, not Orka itself, so the default stays
`inprocess` and a fresh install always works. Opt into Orka once those
prerequisites are in place. See
[experimental/orka/USAGE.md](../experimental/orka/USAGE.md) for the full setup
and [experimental/orka/ARCHITECTURE.md](../experimental/orka/ARCHITECTURE.md) for
how it works.

## Build and push the image

```bash
make image IMAGE=ghcr.io/you/prow-ai-dashboard VERSION=v1.0.0
docker push ghcr.io/you/prow-ai-dashboard:v1.0.0
```

Pushes to `main` and `vX.Y.Z` tags publish the image automatically via
`.github/workflows/image.yml` to `ghcr.io/<owner>/prow-ai-dashboard`. A `vX.Y.Z`
tag additionally publishes the Helm chart to
`oci://ghcr.io/<owner>/charts/prow-ai-dashboard` and attaches the packaged
`.tgz` to the GitHub release (see `.github/workflows/release.yml`).

## Install with Helm

The chart is published to GHCR as an OCI artifact on each release, and its
source lives at `deploy/helm/prow-ai-dashboard`. Supply your consumer-owned
`project.yaml` and `prompts/system.md` at install time; they are never checked
into the engine repo. The `onboard -mode k8s` subcommand scaffolds a project
plus a `deploy/values.yaml` ready to pass here with `-f`; see
[onboarding-a-new-project.md](onboarding-a-new-project.md#step-3a-kubernetes-native).

Install the released chart straight from GHCR (no repo checkout needed). The
chart pins its image to the matching release, so `image.tag` is optional:

```bash
helm install capz oci://ghcr.io/willie-yao/charts/prow-ai-dashboard \
  --version 1.0.0-beta.5 \
  --namespace dashboards --create-namespace \
  --set persistence.storageClass=<your-rwx-class> \
  --set-file project.config=../capz-prow-ai-dashboard/project.yaml \
  --set-file project.systemPrompt=../capz-prow-ai-dashboard/prompts/system.md \
  --set ai.enabled=true \
  --set ai.endpoint=http://vllm.inference.svc.cluster.local/v1/chat/completions \
  --set ai.model=<model-id> \
  --set ai.token=<token>
```

> GHCR packages are private by default. If the pull fails with an auth error,
> make the `charts/prow-ai-dashboard` package public once in the repo's package
> settings, or `helm registry login ghcr.io` first. As a no-auth alternative,
> every release also attaches the packaged chart `.tgz`: download it from the
> release page and `helm install capz ./prow-ai-dashboard-<version>.tgz ...`.

To install from a local checkout instead (e.g. an unreleased change), point Helm
at the chart directory and set `image.tag` to a published image tag:

```bash
helm install capz deploy/helm/prow-ai-dashboard \
  --namespace dashboards --create-namespace \
  --set image.tag=v1.0.0-beta.5 \
  --set persistence.storageClass=<your-rwx-class> \
  --set-file project.config=../capz-prow-ai-dashboard/project.yaml \
  --set-file project.systemPrompt=../capz-prow-ai-dashboard/prompts/system.md \
  --set ai.enabled=true \
  --set ai.endpoint=http://vllm.inference.svc.cluster.local/v1/chat/completions \
  --set ai.model=<model-id> \
  --set ai.token=<token>
```

For production, provide the token via `ai.existingSecret` (see [Reusing
existing config](#reusing-existing-config)) rather than `--set ai.token`, which
lands in shell history and Helm release metadata.

To populate data immediately rather than waiting for the schedule, run the
fetcher once:

```bash
kubectl -n dashboards create job --from=cronjob/capz-prow-ai-dashboard-fetcher fetch-now
```

Then reach the server:

```bash
kubectl -n dashboards port-forward svc/capz-prow-ai-dashboard-server 8080:80
open http://localhost:8080
```

## Configuration reference

Key values (see `deploy/helm/prow-ai-dashboard/values.yaml` for the full set):

| Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `image.repository`, `image.tag` | Engine image; tag defaults to the chart `appVersion`. |
| `mode` | `watch` (continuous worker Deployment, default) or `cron` (scheduled CronJob). |
| `analysis` | `inprocess` (default; in-cluster agentic loop) or `orka` (Kubernetes-native Orka pipeline, recommended when you run an in-cluster inference stack; requires `mode: cron` and Orka installed). |
| `persistence.accessMode` | Must be `ReadWriteMany`. |
| `persistence.storageClass`, `persistence.size` | The shared volume's class and size. |
| `persistence.existingClaim` | Reuse a pre-provisioned PVC instead of creating one. |
| `project.config`, `project.systemPrompt` | Consumer config, via `--set-file`. |
| `project.existingConfigMap` | Reuse a ConfigMap with keys `project.yaml` and `system.md`. |
| `ai.enabled`, `ai.endpoint`, `ai.model`, `ai.token` | AI analysis and its OpenAI-compatible endpoint. |
| `ai.existingSecret`, `ai.tokenSecretKey` | Reuse a Secret holding the token. |
| `fetcher.schedule` | Cron schedule (default every 6 hours). `mode: cron`. |
| `fetcher.watchInterval`, `fetcher.reconcileInterval` | Refresh and full-pass cadence. `mode: watch`. |
| `fetcher.buildsPerJob`, `fetcher.workers`, `fetcher.timeout` | Fetch depth and budget. |
| `fetcher.extraEnv` | Extra env such as `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, or the `ISSUE_TOKEN` / `FIX_TOKEN` write tokens (see [Automatic issues and fix PRs](#automatic-issues-and-fix-prs)). |
| `ingress.enabled`, `ingress.hosts`, `ingress.tls` | Public read path. |
| `server.actions.enabled`, `server.actions.mode` | Turn on write actions; `oauth` (GitHub sign-in) or `proxy` (SSO proxy + bot token). |
| `server.actions.admins` | GitHub logins allowed to file issues / draft fix PRs. |

The public read endpoints (`/data/*`, `/api/capabilities`, `/healthz`) are
unauthenticated. Admin write actions are opt-in: set `server.actions.enabled`
and choose `server.actions.mode` (`oauth` for GitHub sign-in with per-user
attribution, or `proxy` for an upstream SSO proxy plus a bot token), then list
the allowed GitHub logins in `server.actions.admins` (see [server.md](server.md)).

### Enabling actions with Helm

OAuth mode (per-user attribution). Register a GitHub OAuth App first (see
[server.md](server.md#setting-up-oauth-mode)); its callback URL is your
dashboard URL plus `/api/auth/callback`.

```bash
helm upgrade --install capz deploy/helm/prow-ai-dashboard \
  ... \
  --set server.actions.enabled=true \
  --set server.actions.mode=oauth \
  --set 'server.actions.admins={alice,bob}' \
  --set server.actions.oauth.clientId=<client-id> \
  --set server.actions.oauth.clientSecret=<client-secret> \
  --set server.actions.oauth.redirectUrl=https://dashboard.example.com/api/auth/callback \
  --set server.actions.oauth.sessionKey="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

Proxy mode (an SSO proxy fronts the server; a bot token writes):

```bash
helm upgrade --install capz deploy/helm/prow-ai-dashboard \
  ... \
  --set server.actions.enabled=true \
  --set server.actions.mode=proxy \
  --set server.actions.proxy.header=X-Auth-Request-Email \
  --set server.actions.proxy.botToken=<bot-pat> \
  --set 'server.actions.admins={alice,bob}'
```

Provide the OAuth secret/session key or bot token via a pre-made Secret instead
with `server.actions.oauth.existingSecret` (keys `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`,
`SESSION_KEY`) or `server.actions.proxy.existingSecret` (key `BOT_TOKEN`).

`/data/*` serves everything the fetcher writes to the shared volume, matching
the static Pages path exactly. That includes the AI cache and the fetcher's
state files (issue, skill, and fix-PR tracking). None hold credentials, but if
you want those kept off a public ingress, keep the server on an internal
Service or split the fetcher's state onto a separate volume in a follow-up.

## Automatic issues and fix PRs

Both features are off by default. When enabled, the fetcher files GitHub issues
for the highest-signal failures and drafts fix PRs for recurring ones on every
pass: each cron run in `mode: cron`, or each reconcile pass in `mode: watch`.
Each needs the feature turned on in `project.yaml` and a write-scoped token in
the fetcher's environment.

Turn them on in `project.yaml`:

```yaml
issues:
  enabled: true          # repo defaults to branding.source_repo
ai:
  fix_prs:
    enabled: true        # repo defaults to branding.source_repo
```

Supply the tokens through `fetcher.extraEnv`, which lands on both the worker and
the CronJob. The engine reads `ISSUE_TOKEN` for issues and `FIX_TOKEN` for fix
PRs. `ISSUE_TOKEN` wants `issues: write` on the target repo; `FIX_TOKEN` is a
real contributor's PAT with `Contents: write` and `Pull requests: write`. See
[fix-prs.md](fix-prs.md#identity-cla-and-the-token-read-this-first) for the
fork-versus-branch token rules. Source both from a Secret you manage:

```bash
kubectl -n dashboards create secret generic capz-write-tokens \
  --from-literal=ISSUE_TOKEN=<pat> \
  --from-literal=FIX_TOKEN=<pat>
```

```yaml
# values.yaml
fetcher:
  extraEnv:
    - name: ISSUE_TOKEN
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef: { name: capz-write-tokens, key: ISSUE_TOKEN }
    - name: FIX_TOKEN
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef: { name: capz-write-tokens, key: FIX_TOKEN }
```

If a feature is enabled but its token is missing, the fetcher logs a skip and
continues, so a misconfigured token never fails the pass. See
[github-issues.md](github-issues.md) and [fix-prs.md](fix-prs.md) for the
triggers, guardrails, and the rest of the per-feature `project.yaml` fields.

This is the scheduled, unattended path. To let an admin file one issue or draft
one fix PR on demand from the dashboard UI, enable the interactive server
actions instead (see [Enabling actions with Helm](#enabling-actions-with-helm)).

## Reusing existing config

If you manage the project config or credentials outside the chart, point the
chart at them and it will not create its own:

```bash
kubectl -n dashboards create configmap capz-project \
  --from-file=project.yaml=project.yaml \
  --from-file=system.md=prompts/system.md
kubectl -n dashboards create secret generic capz-ai --from-literal=AI_TOKEN=<token>

helm install capz deploy/helm/prow-ai-dashboard \
  --set project.existingConfigMap=capz-project \
  --set ai.enabled=true --set ai.existingSecret=capz-ai \
  --set ai.endpoint=... --set ai.model=...
```
