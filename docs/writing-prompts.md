# Writing a project AI prompt

Every consumer of [prow-ai-dashboard][engine] must ship a `prompts/system.md`
alongside its `project.yaml`. This file is what makes the AI summaries useful
for your project: it tells the model how your components fit together, what
common failures look like, and which signals to skip as known flakes.

The engine hard-errors at startup if `prompts/system.md` is missing or
whitespace-only when `-ai` is enabled. There is no "default project prompt";
generic AI analysis on Prow logs without project context produces hallucinations
faster than it produces signal.

## How the prompt is composed

At fetcher startup the engine assembles the final system prompt sent to the
chat completions API as:

```
<engine BasePrompt>

## Project-specific knowledge

<your prompts/system.md, verbatim>

<engine ResponseFormatFooter>
```

- **`BasePrompt`** ([baseprompt.go][baseprompt]) is a ~150-word universal
  preamble: GCS artifact layout, the `build-log.txt` / `started.json` /
  `junit_*.xml` entry points, and a generic triage order. It is the same for
  every consumer.
- **Your `prompts/system.md`** is the variable part. It is appended verbatim
  with no editorial filtering — what you write is what the model sees.
- **`ResponseFormatFooter`** ([responseformat.go][footer]) pins the JSON
  schema the Go code unmarshals (`summary`, `is_transient`, `root_cause`,
  `severity`, `suggested_fix`, `relevant_files`). Do NOT redeclare it in your
  addendum; if you do, you risk the model returning a shape the engine cannot
  parse.

## Recommended sections

The sections below are what consistently lift summary quality. Pick the ones
that apply; you do not have to use all of them.

### Architecture
5-15 bullets describing how the system under test fits together: top-level
controllers, the resource hierarchy, addons, and the canonical request flow on
a successful run. The model uses this to interpret stack traces and resource
YAMLs.

### Project-specific artifact layout
If your project drops debug data under `artifacts/` in a project-specific
shape (e.g. `artifacts/clusters/{cluster}/machines/{vm}/kubelet.log`), list
the paths the model should consult. The base prompt already covers the
universal Prow files; do not repeat them.

### Common failure patterns
5-15 failure modes the model is likely to encounter, grouped by component.
For each, name the signal that distinguishes it. Concrete log-line excerpts
are more useful than abstract descriptions.

### Transient errors
A bullet list of patterns that should set `is_transient=true` rather than
being flagged as bugs (API throttling, quota exhaustion, image-pull backoff,
DNS flakes, etc.). The engine's regex-based `IsKnownTransient` covers the
most universal cases; add anything your project sees often.

### Triage order
If the universal triage order in the base prompt isn't enough (e.g. for a
provider where a specific log file usually has the answer), spell out the
order. Example: "1. build-log.txt → 2. kubelet.log → 3. cloud-init-output.log
→ 4. <provider> activity log → 5. Machine resource YAML."

### Repos to reference in `relevant_files`
The engine's response schema asks the model for a list of file paths to
investigate. Tell it which GitHub repos are in scope so the paths it returns
are actionable links rather than guesses.

## Worked examples

Two production consumer prompts are available as reference templates.
Both are around 100-150 lines and follow the section structure above.

- **VM-based provider (Azure):** [CAPZ `prompts/system.md`][capz-prompt] —
  ~100 lines covering Azure VM provisioning, kubeadm control-plane init,
  14 documented failure patterns, Azure-specific transient errors, and
  the CAPZ artifact layout.
- **Non-VM provider (CAPD, Docker):** [CAPI core `prompts/system.md`][capi-prompt] —
  ~150 lines covering provider-agnostic CAPI architecture, the CAPD
  Docker provider, three job-type families (E2E / unit / conformance),
  and the per-spec workload-cluster artifact layout. Use this as the
  starting template for any project where CAPD-style or non-cloud-VM
  failure patterns dominate.

A minimal docs-only example also lives in [`configs/example/`][example] in

## Tips

- **Keep it factual.** The model treats your prompt as ground truth. Do not
  speculate about failure modes you have never seen.
- **Quote real log lines.** Where you list a failure pattern, include the
  exact log message the model should match on. Vague descriptions ("CNI
  doesn't start") produce vague summaries.
- **Use markdown headings.** The model uses your section structure to
  organize its reasoning.
- **Length is fine.** 100-300 lines is normal. Beyond that you may start
  crowding out the per-failure evidence in the context window; trim aggressively
  if you see the model ignoring the user message.
- **Iterate against real failures.** Trigger an AI analysis on a known
  failure, read the summary, and refine the prompt where the model got it
  wrong. Clear the AI cache (see below) so the next run regenerates.

## Clearing the AI cache after a prompt edit

The engine caches AI responses keyed by `<test name, failure message>` only,
not by prompt content. After editing `prompts/system.md` you must clear the
cache for the new prompt to take effect:

```yaml
# In your consumer repo, e.g. .github/workflows/clear-cache.yml
on: { workflow_dispatch: {} }
jobs:
  clear:
    uses: willie-yao/prow-ai-dashboard/.github/workflows/reusable-clear-cache.yml@main
    with:
      project_dir: .
```

Run it manually from the Actions tab. The next scheduled deploy will re-run
every analysis under the updated prompt.

## What the engine does NOT add to your prompt

It is worth being explicit: the engine intentionally does not own any
project-specific opinion. That includes:

- The list of components that exist in your project
- Architecture diagrams or dependency chains
- Failure patterns specific to your CI fleet
- Cloud-provider-specific transient errors (Azure-specific quotas, vSphere
  vCenter timeouts, etc.)
- Test-flavor-specific debugging instructions

If you want the model to know any of that, it must be in your
`prompts/system.md`.

One adjacent knob you may also want, **outside** the system prompt: the
list of artifacts attached to each AI call. Configured in `project.yaml`
under `ai.evidence` (machine logs, controller logs, build-log regex
patterns). See the "Evidence sources" section in
[docs/onboarding-a-new-project.md](onboarding-a-new-project.md). Use
this for non-VM providers where the engine's default machine-log list
doesn't match what your CI publishes, or for cloud-specific build-log
patterns that should land in the prompt as `=== Build Log Errors ===`.
