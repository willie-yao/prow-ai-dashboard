# Orka backend: architecture

How the Orka analysis path works at the code level: where each Orka resource is
created, the CRD shapes, and how the engine's in-process harness is reconstructed
out of Kubernetes objects. For how to run it, see [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md). For the
evaluation and the productization call, see the "Headline finding" in
[README.md](README.md).

## The pipeline

The engine's flow is: discover jobs/builds/failing tests, analyze each failure
with the in-process agentic loop, write `dashboard.json` + `jobs/*.json`, serve.
Only the **analysis** step moves to Orka; discovery and output are unchanged.

```
fetcher -ai=false        writes the dashboard skeleton (jobs/*.json, no AI)
   |
orka-producer            one content-addressed Task per failing test
   |                     + per-build, header-routed Tool clones  -> kube-apply
   v
Orka ai-worker           runs the agentic loop per Task, calling the shim tools
   |
orka-ingestor            reads each Task's result, patches it into jobs/*.json,
                         then runs one job-level pattern Task for eligible jobs
   |
server / Pages           unchanged
```

Three of these are code in this repo (`backend/cmd/orka-producer`,
`orka-ingestor`, `orka-artifact-tool`); the ai-worker is Orka's own binary,
carrying the patches in [worker-patches/](worker-patches/).

## Where Orka resources are created

Everything the producer emits is an unstructured `map[string]any` built in Go and
server-side applied through a dynamic client, so the pipeline links no Orka Go
types. The two CRDs it creates:

### Task (one per failing test)

Built by `orka.BuildAITask` (`internal/orka/task.go`). Shape:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.orka.ai/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: az-analysis-<identityHash>              # content address
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: orka-producer
    orka.dashboard/build: <build + analysis-contract Tool scope hash>
spec:
  type: ai
  timeout: <ai.timeout>
  retryPolicy: { maxRetries: <n> }             # when -retries > 0
  webhookURL: <ingestor>                        # when -webhook-url set
  ai:
    providerRef: { name: <provider> }
    model: <model>
    tools: [<tool-b<toolScope>>, ...]           # contract-versioned Tool clones
    systemPrompt: <composed engine prompt + tool addendum>
    prompt: <per-failure user prompt>
```

The producer walks the jobs in the current `dashboard.json`. For every
`status: "failed"` test case it hashes the project/storage scope, job/build
scope, exact test index and rendered prompt, plus the provider, model, timeout,
retry, composed system prompt, selected Tool definitions, and manual version.
This prevents cross-consumer and same-build shard collisions and automatically
invalidates results when the model-visible analysis contract changes.

### Tool (one clone per project x job x build x analysis contract x tool group)

A single artifact tool shim serves every build and bucket. The producer does
**not** create a tool per Task; it clones each base Tool CRD once per distinct
scoped build and analysis contract via `cloneToolForBuild`, injecting
static routing headers:

```yaml
spec:
  http:
    headers:
      X-Build-Prefix: <bucket-relative build dir>
      X-Prow-AI-Scope: <contract-scoped Tool identity>
      X-Bucket: <bucket>
      X-Storage-Provider: <gcs | gcsweb>   # from the consumer's project.yaml
      X-Storage-Base: <gcsweb gateway root>  # only for gcsweb (e.g. S3)
```

The shim requires an Orka-injected bearer token and resolves its backend per
request from producer-owned headers (`orka-artifact-tool/toolenv.go`), so a tool
always reads the Task's own build
in the right bucket **and on the right storage provider** regardless of what the
model passes. Storage is provider-agnostic: the shim reuses the engine's
`internal/storage` (gcs, or gcsweb over an S3 gateway), defaulting from its
`STORAGE_*` env and overriding per request from the `X-Storage-*` headers the
producer derives from `project.yaml`. Invalid explicit routes fail closed.
Contract-scoped browser/cache entries use bounded LRU eviction. Each Tool call
has explicit model-response and artifact-read ceilings. Base Tool CRDs are loaded from
`experimental/orka/manifests/` by `loadBaseTools`.

### The apply

`applyAll` applies Tools before Tasks (Tasks reference them),
using `KubeClient.Apply` (`internal/orka/kube.go`), a server-side-apply Patch
with `FieldManager: orka-producer` and `Force: true`. `RESTConfig`
(`kube.go`) prefers in-cluster config and falls back to kubeconfig + a
`-context` override for local runs. Running without `-apply` only writes the YAML
to `-tasks-out` / `-tools-out` for inspection.

## How the result comes back

The producer writes a private `orka_analysis.json` manifest beside the dashboard
data. It records the project scope, analysis-contract hash, active jobs, and
per-build routing and Tool scopes. `orka-ingestor` loads that manifest and re-derives
each exact Task name from the same job/test index and shared prompt renderer,
then patches the result in place. `applyResult` fetches the
Task's result, parses the analysis JSON, and writes `tc.AISummary` +
`tc.AIAnalysis` with `Mode: "agentic"`, the same wire shape the in-process path
produces. Each analysis stores the contract hash, so a cached result is reused
only while it matches the current producer manifest. The ingestor also reads the
Task's durable execution-event stream. It rejects incomplete response schemas,
analyses below `ai.min_tool_calls`, results without a successful terminal Task
event, quality tools whose last attempt failed, results without a completed
`validate_analysis` call whose token binds the exact final result, and transient
verdicts without a successful `verify_timeline` call. Accepted results carry Tool/model failures, retries,
context truncations, elapsed time, tokens, stop reason, and quality-tool
telemetry. Failing/absent results get the engine's `unavailable`
placeholder via
`setUnavailable`, mirroring `internal/ai/service.go`.

Two ingest modes:

- **Batch** (`-wait`): poll Task phases until terminal, then patch. `markUnavailable`
  reads `TaskPhase` to explain deadline/failure.
- **Event-driven** (`-serve`): a `webhookServer` patches a single
  result as each Task fires its `webhookURL`, serialized so concurrent deliveries
  never corrupt a `jobs/*.json` file. `/status` exposes coverage via
  `skeletonStatus`.

Job-level pattern finalization runs in batch mode after the per-test wait
completes. A successful finalization then runs the shared notification, issue,
and fix-PR reconciliation stage against the finalized files. The optional
webhook receiver patches per-test results only.

Per-build Tool + Task garbage collection is `gcTools`, selecting
by the `orka.dashboard/build` label.

After per-test ingestion, the ingestor runs the same bounded cross-build pattern
contract as the in-process backend. It applies one content-addressed, tool-free
AI Task per eligible job, ingests its `PatternAnalysis`, assigns stable pattern
IDs, and folds systemic verdicts into `flakiness.json`. This makes recurring
patterns available to the existing dashboard and interactive actions. Because
the correlation Task has no source-repository tools, any file path it introduces
in `suggested_fix` is marked as unverified. Its Task identity fingerprints the
project scope, provider/model, timeout/retry policy, prompts, and manual version.

## How the harness is replicated

The engine's in-process analysis is more than "call the model in a loop": it has a
cache, convergence machinery, an always-on critique gate, cross-build pattern
correlation, and skill-driven evidence requirements. Each of those is
reconstructed out of Kubernetes objects and deterministic tool endpoints:

| Engine harness piece | Orka reconstruction | Where |
|---|---|---|
| On-disk analysis cache (keyed by mode+hash) | The Task name fingerprints project/build/test identity plus prompt, provider/model, timeout/retry, and Tool definitions. Re-applying it is a no-op, so the K8s object store is the cache. `-version` remains a manual override for external semantic changes. | `AnalysisTaskName` / `AnalysisContractHash`; `Apply` is idempotent |
| Per-failure build isolation (fetcher scopes each analysis to one build) | Contract-versioned Tool clones with static `X-Build-Prefix` / `X-Bucket` headers; old and new Task contracts cannot share mutable Tool objects. | `ToolScopeID`, `cloneToolForBuild`, shim `toolenv.go` |
| Prompt composition (BasePrompt + system.md + footer) | The producer calls the same `ai.ComposeSystemPrompt` and appends a tool-usage/self-critique addendum. | `toolUsageAddendum` |
| Convergence (loop always yields a final verdict) | Worker patches: forced tools-free finalization near the budget + re-prompt on an empty final message. | `worker-patches/` (2,3) |
| Critique gate: hallucinated-citation guard | `validate_analysis` tool deterministically 1-byte-reads every cited path against the build tree. | `orka-artifact-tool/validate.go` |
| Critique gate: transient discipline | The worker re-prompts an unsupported transient verdict, and the ingestor independently rejects any final transient result without a completed `verify_timeline` event. | `worker-patches/` (4), `timeline.go`, ingestor event acceptance |
| Investigation floor | The producer fingerprints `ai.min_tool_calls`; the ingestor counts `ToolCallStarted` events and rejects shallower results. | `AnalysisManifest.MinToolCalls`, Task events API |
| Per-test recurrence evidence | `check_recurrence` reports whether one test recurs across recent builds. | `orka-artifact-tool/recurrence.go` |
| Job-level cross-build correlation | After per-test ingestion, one content-addressed pattern Task correlates representative failures and writes `PatternAnalysis` + recurring patterns. | `orka-ingestor` + `orka.FinalizePatterns` |
| Skill-driven required evidence | The producer compiles consumer `skills/*.yaml` recipes into the scoped `required_evidence` Tool; the ingestor requires that lookup when recipes exist. | `ai/skills`, `orka-producer`, `orka-artifact-tool/requiredevidence.go` |
| Transient-signature background-noise filter | `check_transient_signatures` tool tails build logs for known-noise patterns. | `orka-artifact-tool/transient.go` |

The engine enforces these *in code*; Orka enforces them as *tools the agent must
call* plus *worker re-prompts*. The consequence, quantified in
[worker-patches/README.md](worker-patches/README.md): the tools/gates guarantee
the model **looks** (process parity), but on a weak model they do not guarantee it
**reasons correctly** (classification stays model-bound). That split is why the
recommendation keeps both paths rather than replacing the engine.

## Provider seam

An Orka `Provider` is just `type: openai` + a `baseURL` + a token secret
(`manifests/1x-*-provider.yaml`), so any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works with no
code change: in-cluster Kimi via Ray Serve (no proxy), vLLM, Dynamo/NIM, Ollama.
Copilot is the one exception; its non-streaming endpoint returns null tool_calls
for Claude, so `manifests/50-copilot-proxy.yaml` de-streams and injects the
`Copilot-Integration-Id` header the Provider cannot set itself.

## Consumer-driven, multi-consumer

The producer reads the tool, storage, and id fields from a consumer's
`project.yaml`: `ai.tools` and `ai.min_tool_calls` (via `resolveTools` and the
acceptance manifest), the `storage`
block (`bucket` + `provider`/`base`/`prow_base`), and the display id. Tool
selection, bucket + provider routing, and the prompt all follow from those, so
the same binaries serve CAPZ (`kubernetes-ci-logs` on GCS, cluster-per-test,
`k8s` tools) and a project on an S3-backed Prow behind gcsweb (`filesystem` only)
unchanged. Every other `ai.*` knob (`max_iters`, `min_gcs_bytes`, `critique.*`,
`evidence.*`) is engine-only and inert on this path: it lives in the worker
patches and the shim tools, not in `project.yaml`.
