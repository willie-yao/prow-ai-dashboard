# Server mode (Kubernetes-native)

The dashboard supports two deployment environments from one codebase:

- **Kubernetes-native (this page).** A small Go server (`backend/cmd/server`)
  serves the dashboard and its JSON over HTTP alongside the inference stack,
  reading from a shared volume a worker or CronJob writes. It adds a capability
  descriptor and admin-gated interactive actions on top of the read contract.
- **Static.** The fetcher writes JSON, GitHub Actions builds the SPA, and GitHub
  Pages serves it. Public, cheap, no backend.

Server mode is a strict superset of the static contract: it serves the exact
same `/data/*.json` files the SPA already reads, then adds a capability
descriptor the frontend uses to discover server-only features. The static path
keeps working unchanged, and all `/data/*.json` schemas stay byte-compatible.

The frontend requests `search-index.json` only after search is focused, opened,
or used. Server mode negotiates gzip for eligible JSON, JavaScript, CSS, and
text responses and sends `Vary: Accept-Encoding`. SSE streams, HEAD responses,
range responses, no-body statuses, `no-transform` responses, and content that
already has a `Content-Encoding` remain uncompressed. Existing cache headers
and private-file filtering are preserved.

Server responses also set a same-origin Content Security Policy, deny framing,
disable MIME sniffing, limit referrer data, and disable unused browser device
features with `Permissions-Policy`. Scripts, connections, images, and fonts are
restricted to the dashboard origin, with `data:` allowed only for images. MUI
and Emotion inject runtime style elements, so `style-src` currently includes
`'unsafe-inline'`; `script-src` remains strict and the SPA contains no inline
startup script.

The server is independent of where the in-process analyzer ran. Pages and
Kubernetes deployments produce the same `jobs/*.json`, so the server contract
remains identical.

## Capability seam

The fetcher writes aggregate progress to `.fetch-status/status.json` and the last 20 terminal pass summaries to `.fetch-status/history.json` on the shared data volume. On POSIX filesystems the directory is mode `0700` and both files are mode `0600`. Some RWX filesystems enforce permissions at mount level, so an unsupported per-file `chmod` does not invalidate a successful atomic write. Private HTTP filtering remains mandatory, and the `/data/*` file server rejects the hidden directory. Authenticated servers expose the versioned aggregate status and an identity-free summary of the latest 10 passes through `/api/fetch-status`, with `Cache-Control: no-store`.

Analysis progress separates accepted private-cache hits, compatible retained results, exact succeeded Task results reused during planning, Tasks created during the current pass, freshly completed analyses, and late Task adoption after planning. It also reports privacy-safe same-build failure-cohort candidates, potential Task savings, actual same-failure result reuse, and the largest cohort without exposing signatures or test identities. Aggregate cache rejection categories cover missing, expired, below-floor, critique, or malformed entries. Recent-pass summaries include only pass type, timestamps, duration, aggregate reuse and Task counts, retries, outcome, and publication state. Pattern progress includes accepted cache hits, separate bounded full-attempt, retry, and ambiguity-repair counts, repair outcomes, and a safe final failure category. Raw errors, Task mappings, run or pass IDs from history, artifact identities, prompts, provider bodies, and filesystem paths are not included. The frontend polls this endpoint without overlapping requests, backs off after failures, and stops polling when the component unmounts.

The frontend discovers its mode by probing `/api/capabilities`:

- In static Pages mode the endpoint does not exist, the probe fails, and the
  frontend stays in read-only static mode.
- In server mode the descriptor is present, and the frontend lights up only the
  features it advertises.

Interactive features are additive and gated behind this descriptor, so the same
build serves both targets. All `/data/*.json` schemas stay byte-compatible.

## Analysis chat API

The server can expose an authenticated, read-only conversation API for a single
published test analysis or recurring failure pattern. Set `ANALYSIS_CHAT_ENABLED=1` with `-project-dir`,
`AUTH_MODE`, `AI_TOKEN`, and the normal AI provider configuration. Chat mode
disables GitHub actions by default and does not require `BOT_TOKEN`. Set
`ACTIONS_ENABLED=1` only when the same server should expose write actions. The server
then advertises `features.analysis_chat: true`. Static Pages deployments do not
advertise or serve the API. In the Helm chart, set `server.chat.enabled=true`
alongside `ai.enabled=true`; authentication uses the settings under
`server.actions`, but write actions remain disabled.

Create a session by posting the selected analysis identity with a unique
`Idempotency-Key` header:

```json
{
  "job_id": "periodic-demo",
  "build_id": "123",
  "test_name": "TestCluster",
  "suite_name": "cluster lifecycle",
  "class_name": "e2e",
  "junit_file": "junit_01.xml",
  "analysis_generated_at": "2026-07-23T12:00:00Z"
}
```

`suite_name`, `class_name`, and `junit_file` disambiguate duplicate test
names. `analysis_generated_at` is
optional, but including it prevents a conversation from silently attaching to a
newer analysis after the page was loaded. A mismatch returns `409 Conflict`.
The lookup endpoint accepts the same reference and returns `204 No Content`
when that admin has no live matching session. The dashboard uses it on mount so
reloads and navigation restore the transcript from shared server storage.

For an analyzed build failure that has no failed JUnit case, include the typed
source and omit `junit_file`:

```json
{
  "job_id": "periodic-demo",
  "build_id": "123",
  "test_name": "Prow job execution",
  "source": "build",
  "suite_name": "Prow",
  "class_name": "job",
  "analysis_generated_at": "2026-07-30T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Build references require `source: "build"` and reject `junit_file`. Omitting
`source` retains the legacy JUnit-reference contract and cannot resolve a build
subject.

For a recurring pattern, post its stable ID and complete content hash instead:

```json
{
  "scope": "pattern",
  "job_id": "periodic-demo",
  "pattern_id": "4d8f...",
  "pattern_hash": "8f6a..."
}
```

Pattern sessions snapshot the published root cause, suggested fix, confidence,
relevant files, and affected builds. The read-only artifact tools expose at
most the three most recent affected builds under
`builds/<build-id>/<artifact-path>`. A changed hash returns `409 Conflict`.
Pattern conversations cannot be promoted as test-analysis corrections or start
source investigation, but an evidence-backed response can still use the existing
chat-to-fix flow.
In the dashboard, a systemic recurring-pattern card with a published content
hash renders the same **Chat with agent** control as a test analysis when at
least one affected build remains in the current job data window. Pattern
conversations use cross-build suggested questions, hide test-only correction
and source-investigation controls, and link build-qualified citations back to
the matching affected run when a web URL is available.
Job-detail and flakiness writers always backfill the canonical content hash and
preserve an existing stable pattern ID. This upgrades cached or older pattern
results without clearing the analysis cache or rerunning pattern analysis.
Older deployed JSON that still lacks the hash shows an explicit stale-data
notice instead of silently hiding chat until the next controlled data refresh.

Post `{"message":"What evidence supports this?"}` to the session's `messages`
endpoint with a new `Idempotency-Key` for that question. Retrying either POST
with the same key and the same body returns the original session state without
creating another session or model turn. Reusing a key for different input
returns `409 Conflict`.

The JSON endpoint waits for the final transcript. The streaming endpoint emits
validated internal progress followed by a `session` event. The frontend groups
those phases into Investigating, Validating evidence, and Finalizing, with a
separate cancelling state. Progress includes the turn start time, elapsed-time
anchor, bounded validation retry count, and authoritative `turns_used` and
`max_turns`. Reconnecting with the same idempotency key follows the already-running
turn on any replica.

The response contains the full transcript. User messages include the accepted
request ID so the frontend can reconcile a response lost after the server
committed it. Every assistant response requires `answer` and `citations`. An
`assessment` of `supports`, `challenges`, or `inconclusive` is optional, as is a
complete proposed revision for a challenges response. Normal follow-up answers
do not need either optional field. A proposed revision does not alter
`jobs/*.json` or the published analysis.
While a turn is running, the owner-safe response also includes its request ID,
question, phase, and update time. A reloaded client reconnects with the same
request ID, and can still cancel it from another server replica.
Every session response also includes `turns_used` and `max_turns`. These are the
same admitted-attempt values used by server enforcement. Pending, successful,
failed, cancelled, and unknown-outcome requests consume an attempt once. An
idempotent replay does not consume another attempt, while an explicit retry with
a new request ID does.

Sessions are persisted under `ANALYSIS_CHAT_STATE_DIR`, bound to the
authenticated login, limited to ten admitted attempts including failed turns,
and expire after two hours of inactivity by default. A completed or failed turn
refreshes the expiry. The state file is private and excluded
from `/data/*`. Replicas coordinate short state transitions with an advisory
lock on the shared filesystem, while model calls run without holding that lock.
Session lookup resolves the current published analysis before matching the
owner's latest transcript, so changed test timestamps and pattern hashes do not
attach an older conversation.
The shared RWX volume must support advisory file locking, atomic rename, and file and directory synchronization.
The persisted file contains private transcripts and selected failure context, so
volume access and backups must be treated as operator-private data.

Application-generated terminal errors carry a private outcome header so the
frontend can distinguish them from an ingress-generated `502` or `504` after a
committed response. An in-flight turn carries a lease longer than the HTTP model
timeout. If a pod
dies before recording the result, another replica marks that request outcome
unknown instead of running the same idempotency key twice. The client reloads
the authoritative session before allowing an explicit retry. Startup cleanup,
a lifecycle-bound periodic cleanup loop, and request-time cleanup remove
expired sessions from the persisted file and release global and per-owner
capacity.
Finalization prefers a strict JSON Schema response and falls back to bounded
plain-JSON extraction for compatible providers. At most one response-contract
retry is admitted, and the retry receives only safe validation feedback. Model
response parsing scans a bounded set of complete JSON objects, including fenced
output and provider metadata wrappers, and validates each candidate against the
strict response and evidence contracts. A previously validated draft may be
retained when a later finalization response is unusable. Citation
paths, quotes, and line ranges still require evidence read during that turn.

Terminal failures use safe categories: provider request failed, model response
could not be validated, evidence citation validation failed, request timed out,
or request cancelled. Provider bodies, prompts, tokens, private paths, and
artifact content are not returned. Content-free logs record the failure stage,
model-call and provider-attempt counts, HTTP status, JSON candidate count, and
validation category.
State version 2 stores the active question as an additive optional field so old
and new replicas can share the file during a rolling upgrade. An old writer may
drop that field, in which case the new client follows the request by polling
until it completes or becomes terminal. Version 1 files still migrate without
dropping completed transcripts. The bridge also accepts the short-lived version
3 format from the preceding release and rewrites it as version 2 without
dropping the active question. Version 3 replicas already accept version 2, so
the mixed rollout remains readable in both directions.

Operational settings:

| Environment variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ANALYSIS_CHAT_STATE_DIR` | `<data-dir>/.analysis-chat` | Private persisted session state and lock file. A path beneath the public data root must use a dot-prefixed top-level directory. |
| `ANALYSIS_CHAT_SESSION_TTL` | `2h` | Conversation retention. |
| `ANALYSIS_CHAT_MAX_SESSIONS` | `128` | Deployment-wide live-session cap. |
| `ANALYSIS_CHAT_MAX_SESSIONS_PER_OWNER` | `8` | Per-login live-session cap. |
| `ANALYSIS_CHAT_MAX_ACTIVE_TURNS_PER_OWNER` | `2` | Concurrent background turns per login. |
| `ANALYSIS_CHAT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE` | `10` | Newly admitted turns per login in a rolling minute. |
| `ANALYSIS_CHAT_TIMEOUT` | `2m` | Background turn bound. Slow local providers may increase it up to `30m`. |

The agent uses only the configured read-only filesystem and Kubernetes artifact
tools. It has no shell, repository write, or GitHub action capability.
Cancellation is idempotent for completed requests. A disconnected streaming
client does not cancel the server-owned turn; it can reconnect with the same
request ID. Server shutdown and explicit cancellation stop the background model
context and persist a terminal cancelled outcome.

## Source investigation API

See [Orka architecture in prow-ai-dashboard](orka-architecture.md) for how this
read-only Agent path differs from container analysis and fix generation.

Source investigation is an optional Kubernetes-native extension to analysis
chat. Set `ANALYSIS_SOURCE_INVESTIGATION_ENABLED=1` and configure
`ai.source_investigation` in `project.yaml`. The server then advertises
`features.source_investigation: true`. Static Pages mode never serves or
advertises this capability. The dashboard adds an **Investigate source** control
to completed assistant responses and follows persisted progress over SSE. Users
can reconnect to an interrupted stream, cancel an active Task, and review the
verified finding and citations in the conversation.

A source request starts from one completed chat request, not an arbitrary prompt.
Post the chat request ID with a new `Idempotency-Key`:

```json
{"chat_request_id":"chat-request-123"}
```

The server binds the request to the authenticated session owner and snapshots the
selected build, published analysis generation timestamp, chat question, and chat
answer. It resolves the effective `ai.source_repo` only from that build's exact
`repo_refs` entry. The revision must be a full commit SHA. The server never falls
back to the decorated build commit, a branch name, or current `main`. It accepts a
bare full SHA or Prow's unambiguous `ref:fullSHA` form. Composite presubmit refs
are rejected because they do not identify the exact merged checkout. For sessions
created before repository refs were persisted, the server re-reads the same job
and build while requiring the original analysis timestamp to still match.

The runtime creates an Orka agent Task at the pinned revision with Orka's enforced
`orka.ai/agent-read-only` guard. Unsupported guarded runtimes fail before agent
execution. The Task permits repository read tools, disables Bash and edit tools,
and uses a workspace initializer so the read-only Git credential is not mounted
into the agent container. A dedicated server ServiceAccount receives Task-only
create, get, patch, and delete permissions. The runtime rejects any result that
contains a workspace diff or push branch. It never receives `BOT_TOKEN` or
`FIX_TOKEN`.

The agent returns a bounded deterministic state (`already_present`,
`actionable_code_change`, `actionable_configuration_change`, or `inconclusive`),
validated remediation metadata when actionable, a finding, confidence,
relationship to the published analysis, investigation direction, and source
citations. Every citation path and
line range is validated and its quote is checked against the same pinned GitHub
revision before `verified: true` is persisted. Public repositories need no extra
credential. Private repositories require a read-only token in
`SOURCE_INVESTIGATION_GITHUB_TOKEN`; the Helm chart wires the configured
GitHub read-token Secret. A missing file, changed quote, unsafe path, mutable
revision, or unavailable verification source fails the request instead of
presenting an unverified citation.

Requests share the private analysis chat state file, owner binding, rolling rate
limit, advisory lock, expiry, and replica-safe lease behavior. They continue
after an SSE disconnect and expose only `queued`, `cloning_source`,
`investigating_source`, `verifying_citations`, `finalizing`, or `cancelling`
progress. Cancellation is idempotent and deletes the active Task on timeout or
client cancellation. Before starting, the UI identifies the exact repository and
commit when available and explains that source investigation starts a separate
read-only coding-agent Task with a larger cost and security boundary.

Additional settings:

| Environment variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ANALYSIS_SOURCE_INVESTIGATION_ENABLED` | `false` | Advertise and serve source investigation. Requires analysis chat. |
| `ANALYSIS_SOURCE_INVESTIGATION_MAX_PER_SESSION` | `8` | Persisted source requests per chat session. |
| `ANALYSIS_SOURCE_INVESTIGATION_MAX_ACTIVE_PER_OWNER` | `1` | Concurrent source Tasks per login. |
| `SOURCE_INVESTIGATION_GITHUB_TOKEN` | empty | Optional read-only token for pinned citation verification in private GitHub repositories. |

## Analysis correction overlays

Set `ANALYSIS_CORRECTIONS_ENABLED=1` together with analysis chat to allow
administrators to promote a structured `challenges` response. Only the agent's
validated `proposed_revision` and verified citations are eligible. The server
persists a private 15-minute preview, requires an explicit confirmation request,
and writes active or revoked corrections to `analysis_corrections.json`.

Corrections never modify `jobs/*.json`. The frontend applies an active correction
only while the exact job, build, test identity, and `analysis_generated_at`
still match. A newer generated analysis makes the overlay visibly stale and
restores the generated conclusion. Revocation also restores the original while
the private ledger retains proposer, confirmer, revoker, session, request, and
audit timestamps.

## Private analysis traces

When admin authentication is configured, the server advertises
`features.analysis_traces: true` and adds a **Traces** page. The page shows the
bounded, content-free metadata from `ai_traces.json`, including response IDs,
provider API mode, request duration and usage, tool names, compaction, critique,
and finalization decisions. The trace API and download include content-free
pattern candidate counts, scan truncation, safe stages, safe failure categories,
and repair outcomes. Each trace links back to the matching test and build.

Trace responses and downloads include the same safe engine identity advertised by
`/api/capabilities`, so operators can tie a private diagnostic artifact to the
exact engine commit without exposing registry credentials or cluster metadata.

The API decodes the known trace schema rather than serving the file directly.
Requests are capped at 64 MiB, responses use `Cache-Control: no-store`, and both
endpoints require the same admin identity used by actions. A missing trace file
returns 404 and the page renders an empty state. Static Pages deployments never
advertise the feature and continue stripping `ai_traces.json` before publication.

## Chat-to-fix bridge

When analysis chat and write actions are both configured, the server advertises
`features.chat_fix: true`. A client can request a fix preview for one successful
assistant response:

```http
POST /api/analysis-chat/sessions/{sessionID}/requests/{chatRequestID}/fix/preview
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "pattern_id": "<recurring-pattern-id>",
  "source_request_id": "<required-successful-actionable-source-request-id>",
  "instruction": "<optional-maintainer-direction>"
}
```

The client selects only identifiers and the optional maintainer instruction. It
cannot submit answer text, revisions, citations, or source findings. The server
reconstructs those fields from the owner-bound private chat state and requires:

- a successful assistant response with verified artifact citations,
- the original published analysis generation and content to remain current,
- analysis freshness and the recurring pattern to come from one job-detail snapshot,
- the recurring pattern to belong to the same job and include the selected build,
- a source request to belong to that response and have a successful, independently
  verified actionable code or configuration result with a validated remediation target.

Generation receives the selected assistant answer, optional evidence-backed
revision, verified artifact citations, the required verified source finding,
repository, immutable revision, remediation target, and citations, the existing `PatternAnalysis`, and the bounded maintainer
instruction. It never receives the complete transcript. The response is the
normal fix `PreviewResult`; post its token to `/api/actions/confirm` to open the
exact reviewed draft through the existing confirmation workflow. Confirmation state is stored in the shared private volume and remains idempotent
across replicas and restarts for the preview retention window: retrying the same
token after a lost success response returns the original URL, while a concurrent
confirmation returns 409 until the first attempt finishes. The persisted lease
tracks the configured action timeout and carries a fenced attempt ID, so a stale
completion cannot overwrite a newer retry.

The dashboard exposes **Use this finding in a fix proposal** only for completed
evidence-backed responses whose selected build belongs to an actionable recurring
pattern. Before generation, the user reviews the selected pattern, assistant
answer, proposed revision, artifact citations, required actionable source result,
and maintainer instruction. The generated draft then uses the existing preview and
confirmation UI.

## Admin-gated actions

The write endpoints let an admin file an issue or draft a fix PR for a specific
failure on demand, reusing the same engines the scheduled fetch uses. They are
off unless the server is started with `-project-dir` and `AUTH_MODE` selects an
auth mechanism. When enabled, the server sets `features.actions: true` for
resolve controls. It also sets `features.action_requests: true` when the action
runner supports persistent drafts, which enables the issue and fix controls.

Before rendering File issue or Propose fix, the frontend calls the authenticated
eligibility endpoint. The server resolves the current published subject and runs
the same deterministic pinned-source verification used by draft generation. The
endpoint returns `actionable`, `investigation_required`, `already_present`, or
`more_evidence_required`. It does not call a model, create an Orka Task, persist
an action request, or send draft-ready email. Draft endpoints repeat verification
and remain authoritative.

File issue and Mark resolved work in the standard server image. Propose fix
starts the local `opencode` runtime and also needs git. The standard distroless
image contains neither tool, so fix previews report unavailable unless you
deploy a custom server image that includes them.

Systemic-pattern email links can deep-link into this flow with the public pattern
id and requested action. The link itself is an inert GET. After authentication,
the frontend requires an explicit **Generate draft** click before creating a
persistent action request.

The frontend review flow posts to `/api/failures/{id}/{action}/requests`, polls
the returned request, and shows the exact issue or draft fix PR before anything
is posted to GitHub. Refining a ready draft creates a replacement request and
atomically cancels the superseded request. The old request exposes
`superseded_by` so clients can recover the replacement after a lost response.
Confirmation posts the persisted
draft through `/api/action-requests/{id}/confirm`. Requests are bound to the
admin who generated them and expire after 24 hours.

The synchronous `*/preview` and `/api/actions/confirm` endpoints expose the same
two-phase contract for direct API clients. Their preview token is single-use,
expires after 15 minutes, and is bound to the admin who generated it.

Two auth modes, both keeping the admin allowlist (`ADMIN_LOGINS`):

- **`oauth`** (per-user attribution): the operator registers a GitHub OAuth App.
  Admins sign in with GitHub; the server holds each admin's own OAuth token in
  an encrypted, httpOnly session cookie and performs the write as them, so the
  issue or PR is attributed to the real user. No token is ever entered in the
  browser. Needs `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL`
  (the App's callback), and `SESSION_KEY`. Public issue and fix targets use the
  least-privilege `public_repo` scope by default. Set
  `OAUTH_PRIVATE_REPOSITORIES=true` only when an action target is private.
- **`proxy`** (bot attribution): an upstream SSO proxy (oauth2-proxy, IAP, ...)
  authenticates the user and passes their identity in a trusted header
  (`AUTH_PROXY_HEADER`, e.g. `X-Auth-Request-Email`); a single `BOT_TOKEN`
  performs the write. Simplest when you already run an authenticating proxy.

The `Authenticator` is a seam, so the two modes share one code path and a third
mechanism can be added without touching the handlers. Sessions are stateless
(encrypted cookie), CSRF is covered by a `SameSite=Lax` cookie plus an Origin
check, and tokens are never logged or returned to the browser. Behind a reverse
proxy that serves a public hostname but forwards a different `Host` to the
server (e.g. Azure Front Door), the Origin check needs the public origin: in
oauth mode the `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL` host is trusted automatically, and
`TRUSTED_ORIGINS` adds any others (required in proxy mode).

### Auth endpoints (oauth mode)

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/auth/login` | Redirect to GitHub to sign in. |
| `GET /api/auth/callback` | OAuth callback; establishes the session. |
| `GET /api/auth/user` | The signed-in admin, or 401. |
| `POST /api/auth/logout` | Clear the session. |

### Setting up oauth mode

1. Register a GitHub OAuth App at
   <https://github.com/settings/developers> -> **New OAuth App** (or under an
   org: **Settings -> Developer settings -> OAuth Apps**). Set:
   - **Application name**: anything, e.g. `myproject-dashboard`.
   - **Homepage URL**: your dashboard URL, e.g. `https://dashboard.example.com`
     (or `http://localhost:8080` for local testing).
   - **Authorization callback URL**: the dashboard URL plus
     `/api/auth/callback`, e.g. `https://dashboard.example.com/api/auth/callback`
     (or `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback` locally). This must match
     `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL` exactly.
2. Click **Register application**, then **Generate a new client secret**. Copy
   the client ID and secret.
3. Generate a session key (any long random string), e.g.
   `openssl rand -base64 32`.
4. Choose repository access. The server derives the GitHub scope instead of
   accepting an arbitrary scope:

   | Features | `OAUTH_PRIVATE_REPOSITORIES` | GitHub scope |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Chat only | `false` | `read:user` |
   | Actions against public repositories | `false` | `public_repo` |
   | Actions against private repositories | `true` | `repo` |

   Keep the default `false` for public targets. The `repo` scope grants broad
   access to both public and private repositories available to the signed-in
   admin. Chat-only OAuth always uses `read:user` and rejects private-repository
   access.
5. Run the server with these env vars:

   | Variable | Purpose |
   | --- | --- |
   | `AUTH_MODE=oauth` | Select OAuth login. |
   | `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | The App's client ID. |
   | `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | The App's client secret. |
   | `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL` | The callback URL registered above. |
   | `SESSION_KEY` | Random secret seeding the session-cookie encryption. |
   | `ADMIN_LOGINS` | Comma-separated GitHub logins allowed to act. |
   | `OAUTH_PRIVATE_REPOSITORIES` | Optional boolean. Defaults to `false`; set `true` only for actions against private repositories. |
   | `HSTS_ENABLED=1` | Optional; send `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000` when HTTPS is deployed. |
   | `COOKIE_INSECURE=1` | Optional; allow the cookie over plain http for local testing only. |
   | `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | Optional; extra public origins the CSRF guard accepts (comma-separated) when behind a proxy. The `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL` host is trusted automatically. |

   ```bash
   make build-server fe-build
   AUTH_MODE=oauth COOKIE_INSECURE=1 \
   OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<client-id> OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<client-secret> \
   OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback \
   SESSION_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" ADMIN_LOGINS=your-login \
   OAUTH_PRIVATE_REPOSITORIES=false \
   ./bin/server -data-dir=frontend/public/data -static-dir=frontend/dist \
     -project-dir=../myproject-dashboard
   ```

   Open <http://localhost:8080>, go to a failing job's pattern, click **Sign in
   to file issues or fixes**, authorize, and the action buttons appear.

   Helm deployments enable HSTS and secure OAuth cookies by default. The chart
   accepts insecure cookies only through its explicit local-development value.

`OAUTH_SCOPE` is no longer supported. Remove it and choose repository access
with `OAUTH_PRIVATE_REPOSITORIES`. After reducing access from `repo` to
`public_repo`, every admin must sign out of the dashboard and sign in again.
For certainty that GitHub does not reuse the previous broad authorization,
revoke the OAuth App under the admin's GitHub application settings before
signing in again. The OAuth client ID, secret, callback URL, and admin allowlist
do not otherwise change.

### Setting up proxy mode

Use this when an authenticating proxy (oauth2-proxy, Google IAP, ...) already
sits in front of the server and injects the signed-in user in a header. The
server trusts that header, so it must be reachable **only** through the proxy.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AUTH_MODE=proxy` | Select proxy mode. |
| `AUTH_PROXY_HEADER` | Header carrying the user, e.g. `X-Auth-Request-Email`. |
| `BOT_TOKEN` | GitHub PAT that performs the writes (bot account). |
| `ADMIN_LOGINS` | Required comma-separated allowlist of identities that may act. An empty list fails closed. |
| `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | Public origin(s) the CSRF guard accepts (comma-separated), e.g. `https://dash.example.net`. Required when the proxy's public host differs from the forwarded `Host`. |

## Running locally

```bash
# Fetch data first (see docs/development.md), then serve it:
make serve                 # builds bin/server, serves frontend/public/data

# Or serve a self-contained build (SPA + data from one origin):
make build-server fe-build
./bin/server -data-dir=frontend/public/data -static-dir=frontend/dist
```

Flags: `-addr` (default `:8080`), `-data-dir` (default `data`), `-static-dir`
(optional built SPA; empty serves data and API only). Add `-project-dir` plus
the `AUTH_MODE` env above to enable admin actions.


## Asynchronous action requests

Email deep links and the in-page issue and fix buttons use persistent action
requests. Generation runs in the server process while request metadata and ready
drafts are stored in `action_request_state.json`. The state file is not served
under `/data`.
Requests expire after 24 hours, are bound to the requesting authenticated login,
and require the current user's GitHub token only when generating or confirming.
Raw GitHub tokens are never persisted. A server restart marks unfinished pending
requests failed; ready drafts survive and remain reviewable.

When `notifications.email.action_links` is enabled and the server receives
`EMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD`, it emails the configured recipients after a draft becomes
ready. The review link still requires the same authenticated login that created
the request.

## Pattern refresh freshness

Each job detail includes additive `pattern_refresh` metadata with `current`, `retained`, `failed`, `not_applicable`, or `unavailable` state. `flakiness.json` carries aggregate counts and a job-status map. Freshness is outside `PatternAnalysis` and does not change pattern identity. Server write actions require `current` state and current evidence. Read-only pattern chat may use retained evidence only while every referenced build remains available.

## AI usage reporting

When `ai.usage.enabled` and authentication are configured, `GET /api/ai-usage`
merges the private fetcher and server ledgers. The default range is the latest
30 UTC days. `start` and `end` use `YYYY-MM-DD`, and repeated `feature`
parameters filter AI features. `GET /api/ai-usage/download` downloads the same
filtered report. Cost nanounits are serialized as strings. Coverage is
`complete`, `partial`, or `unavailable`.


## AI usage observability

The authenticated report includes the selected model and operator-supplied
`ai.usage.pricing` rule. Complete, partial, and unavailable coverage distinguish
fully reported, incompletely reported, and absent token accounting. Raw ledgers
remain inaccessible through `/data/*`.
