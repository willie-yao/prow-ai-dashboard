# Orka backend preview

Runs the dashboard's AI failure analysis through
[Orka](https://github.com/orka-agents/orka), a Kubernetes-native agent
orchestration platform, instead of the engine's in-process agentic loop. Discovery
and output are unchanged; only the per-failure analysis step moves to Orka Tasks
that run alongside your inference stack.

> **Strategic preview.** Orka is the long-term Kubernetes orchestration backend
> for per-failure Tasks, retries, telemetry, and agent runtimes. It is still under
> heavy development. Today `analysis: orka` requires a compatible Orka control
> plane, Provider, and worker. The intended product experience is for the
> dashboard deployment to manage those dependencies. The in-process backend
> remains the self-contained first install while that integration is completed.

## Docs

- **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** - how to deploy and run the Orka path, the config it
  reads, and the knobs. Start here.
- **[EVALUATION.md](EVALUATION.md)** - how to compare Orka safely with a separate release and data claim.
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - how it works: where each Orka resource
  is created, the CRD shapes, and how the engine's harness (cache, convergence,
  critique, skills) is reconstructed out of Kubernetes objects.
- **[worker-patches/](worker-patches/)** - the pinned, tested Orka AI-worker
  compatibility image, patch, version matrix, and measured convergence results.
- **[`orka-ops.sh`](orka-ops.sh)** - installation preflight, a disposable
  Provider smoke Task, batch status, and a project-scoped Task and Tool GC preview.

## Headline finding

Orka + a strong model (claude-sonnet-4.5) produces excellent, artifact-grounded
analyses that match or beat the engine's reference labels on the hardest CAPZ
cases. The first weak-model pass closed protocol convergence and transient-check
discipline, but a Kimi DRA spike still followed later teardown symptoms because
the Orka seed omitted the JUnit failure body containing the initiating cache
error. The current path closes that harness gap by seeding the bounded failure
message, failure body, filtered artifact tree, and a matched evidence plan with
ranked exact candidate paths, then preserving successful Tool observations in an
evidence ledger across proactive context compaction. Model capability still
bounds the final reasoning, but the weak model now starts with a deterministic
investigation checklist instead of depending on a voluntary recipe lookup.
Orka remains opt-in during preview while these parity improvements are evaluated
against the cheaper models operators are likely to run. This preserves a working
self-contained path while the managed Orka deployment experience is built.
Convergence and discipline numbers are in
[worker-patches/README.md](worker-patches/README.md).

## Fix-PR generation runtime

`ai.fix_prs.agent_runtime.type: orka` moves only coding-agent generation into an
Orka Agent workspace. The engine still pins the base SHA, reconstructs and
validates the diff, runs critique and independent verification, and opens the
PR. Enable chart RBAC with `orka.fixRuntime.enabled: true`; private repositories
should use a separate read-only `git_secret` for the Orka workspace. The
referenced Agent runtime must support workspace diff capture and structured
results, such as the OpenCode runtime implementation maintained in Orka. Failed
or cancelled content-addressed Tasks are deleted and recreated, while each Task
also carries the configured Orka retry policy.

## Known constraints

- **Execution events are required.** The ingestor reads each Task's event stream
  to enforce the tool-call floor, terminal outcome, successful required quality tools,
  recipe lookup when the initial evidence plan is incomplete, a `submit_analysis`
  token bound to the exact final
  JSON, and transient timeline evidence before publishing a result. Successful
  artifact content reads return scoped evidence tokens, and `submit_analysis`
  requires those tokens for every cited path and recipe evidence group.
  Recurrence, diff, and transient-signature checks are advisory; failures remain
  visible in telemetry without discarding a validated analysis.
- **Scheduled side effects run in batch mode.** The skeleton fetch disables
  side effects. The ingestor runs the same notifications, issue reconciliation,
  and fix-PR reconciliation as the in-process fetcher after job-level pattern
  finalization, or directly after ingestion when pattern analysis is disabled.
  Finalization and side-effect errors fail the batch so the CronJob retries.
  Mount the consumer project config and provide the same side-effect credentials
  to the ingestor. Webhook mode patches per-test results only.
- **The pinned worker supports both OpenAI APIs.** It tries Responses first,
  falls back to Chat Completions when unsupported, sends `store: false` on
  Responses requests, and records API mode plus response ID for debugging.
  `orka.apiMode` makes the expected mode part of Task identity and ingestion.
- **Copilot needs the de-streaming proxy.** Copilot's non-streaming endpoint
  returns null tool_calls for Claude (the calls only arrive over streaming SSE).
  manifests/50-copilot-proxy.yaml de-streams so the worker sees real tool calls.
  Standard OpenAI-compatible endpoints (vLLM, Ray Serve, Dynamo/NIM, Ollama) do NOT
  need it - point a Provider straight at them.
- **The compatibility worker is required.** Small models otherwise fail to
  converge and skip the verify_timeline discipline. Pin the published worker tag
  or digest from the [compatibility matrix](worker-patches/COMPATIBILITY.md).
- **Artifact-tool authentication is required.** The Helm chart creates and
  preserves a release-scoped bearer Secret by default. External shim deployments
  must provide `orka.artifactTool.auth.existingSecret`. The service accepts
  routing only from producer-owned headers and the included NetworkPolicy limits
  ingress to Orka AI-worker pods.
- **SSRF guard.** Orka marks tools whose URL resolves to a private/loopback IP as
  Available=false. In-cluster ClusterIPs are private, so the tools show unavailable
  but still work (the worker does not gate on availability).
- **Cluster mapping (CAPZ).** A CAPZ e2e build runs many specs, each with its own
  cluster. The k8s tool group (35-k8s-tools.yaml, discover-clusters /
  find-my-cluster) lets the agent map a failing test to its cluster; enable it via
  ai.tools: [filesystem, k8s]. Filesystem-only consumers (e.g. non-CAPI projects)
  set ai.tools: [filesystem].
