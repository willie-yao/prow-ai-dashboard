# AI diagnostic skills and project recipes

> Status: Engine profiles plus consumer extensions. Skills extend the always-on
> critique gate and the Orka required-evidence contract.

Skills are YAML diagnostic recipes that steer the analysis toward canonical
evidence. A recipe contains trigger regexes, required artifact-path groups, and
a short investigation procedure.

The engine composes one merged set for both analysis backends:

1. **Engine Prow profile.** Always enabled because the product analyzes Prow
   runs. It teaches the distinction between `build-log.txt` and JUnit details,
   the roles of Prow metadata files, artifact-tree navigation, timeline
   ordering, cleanup noise, and last-passing comparisons.
2. **Engine Kubernetes profile.** Enabled when the effective `ai.tools`
   selection includes `k8s` or an individual `k8s.*` tool. It contains
   provider-neutral procedures for Machine and Node initialization, Pod
   startup, cluster provisioning, and Service, API, DNS, and kube-proxy
   connectivity.
3. **Consumer recipes.** Loaded from
   `<project-dir>/skills/*.{yaml,yml}` for project and provider knowledge.

These are composition sources, not precedence layers. The complete merged set
is sorted by priority descending and ID ascending, and only recipes whose
triggers match a model draft are surfaced for that draft.

The universal system prompt stays small. The Prow profile is engine-owned
because Prow artifacts are part of the product contract. Kubernetes knowledge
is conditional because some Prow consumers do not produce Kubernetes cluster
dumps or use the cluster-navigation tools. Provider details such as CAPZ,
Azure resources, ASO, and project flavor behavior remain consumer-owned.

## What a skill is

Each recipe declares:

1. **Triggers:** regex patterns matched against the model draft
   (`root_cause`, `summary`, `suggested_fix`, and `relevant_files`).
2. **Required evidence:** groups of artifact-path regexes. Each group is
   satisfied when the agent successfully reads one matching path.
3. **Procedure:** short diagnostic guidance returned when a recipe matches.

Procedures are untrusted guidance. They cannot override the system prompt, Tool
constraints, the result schema, or the tool budget. The in-process critique
wraps procedures with this boundary, and Orka returns the same boundary from
`required_evidence`.

When a recipe matches and evidence is missing, the in-process gate re-prompts
the model with the missing groups. Orka prepends a complete initial evidence plan
when every matched group has a candidate. Truncated, unmatched, or no-candidate
plans still require `required_evidence`, and `submit_analysis` validates the same
groups in either path.

## When to author a skill

A skill is the right tool when **all** of the following are true:

- The same failure pattern reappears across multiple builds.
- A canonical diagnostic procedure exists (e.g. "for an x509 webhook
  failure, always look at the cert-manager Certificate config and
  the webhook server secret").
- The weaker AI model used by the consumer (e.g. Qwen3-235B) stops
  short of that procedure even with the engine's prompt-side rules.

If the model already does the right thing on this failure pattern,
do not author a skill: extra triggers just inflate the recipe set
hash and invalidate cache for no benefit.

## Schema

```yaml
# REQUIRED. Unique consumer identifier within the merged skill set.
# Do not use the reserved engine. prefix. Kebab-case is recommended,
# e.g. webhook-tls-failure or machine-bootstrap-empty-logs.
id: webhook-tls-failure

# Optional human-readable label. Defaults to id. Surfaced in feedback.
name: Webhook TLS failure

# Optional one-line guidance to the recipe author. Not shown to the
# model; documentation only.
description: |
  CAPI bootstrap webhook fails with x509 errors during workload-cluster
  create.

# Optional priority for ordering when multiple recipes match. Higher
# first; default 100. Use to pin a specific recipe ahead of a broader
# one.
priority: 200

# REQUIRED. Regex patterns OR'd together. Matched against the joined
# (root_cause + summary + suggested_fix + relevant_files) text of the
# model's draft. Use (?i) for case-insensitive matching.
triggers:
  - "(?i)x509:?\\s*certificate"
  - "(?i)webhook.*tls"

# Optional but usually present. Evidence groups the agent must satisfy
# before critique accepts a draft that matched this recipe. Each group
# is satisfied if any single regex matches any path the agent
# successfully read. An optional when list limits a group to matching
# drafts, so one recipe can require different evidence by failure class.
required_evidence:
  - id: cert-manager-config
    description: cert-manager Certificate or Issuer config
    when:
      - "(?i)certificate|issuer|x509"
    any_of:
      - "config/certmanager/.*\\.ya?ml"
      - ".*certificate\\.ya?ml"
  - id: webhook-secret
    description: webhook server cert secret contents
    any_of:
      - ".*webhook.*secret.*"

# Optional markdown guidance quoted back to the model on retry. Keep
# short and tool-oriented: name the canonical artifacts and the
# specific signals to look for. Do NOT issue blanket instructions
# that contradict the engine system prompt. The engine wraps this block
# with a guidance-only disclaimer, but a well-scoped procedure is still
# better.
procedure: |
  1. List cert-manager Certificate objects:
     kubectl get certificate -A
  2. Inspect the webhook server cert secret in the bootstrap cluster
     under artifacts/clusters/bootstrap/logs/cert-manager-system/.
  3. Compare the Certificate DNS names to the webhook service DNS
     name from the webhook configuration manifest.
```

## Loading and composition

Skills are loaded once at startup. The fetcher and Orka producer call the same
merged loader with the same effective tool selection.

Loading is strict:

- Every selected engine recipe is embedded in the binary and parsed with the
  same schema as consumer recipes. A malformed built-in is a startup error.
- A missing or empty consumer `skills/` directory is allowed.
- Every present `.yaml` or `.yml` file must parse with strict YAML. Unknown
  fields, invalid regexes, and read errors abort startup.
- IDs must be unique across the complete merged set. The `engine.` prefix is
  reserved for built-ins, so consumers cannot silently replace engine recipes.
- The final order is deterministic: priority descending, then ID ascending.
  Source filename and profile load order do not affect the result.

The engine logs the selected profiles and merged hash:

```text
Loaded 6 AI skill recipe(s) (profiles=prow,kubernetes, hash=a1b2c3d4)
```

## Profile selection and Kubernetes opt-out

The Prow profile is always active. The Kubernetes profile follows `ai.tools`:

```yaml
ai:
  tools: [filesystem, k8s]  # Prow plus Kubernetes profiles
```

For a consumer where Kubernetes recipes are inappropriate, keep only the
filesystem group:

```yaml
ai:
  tools: [filesystem]       # Prow profile only
```

No separate profile field is needed. This keeps the diagnostic contract aligned
with the tools the model can actually call. Consumer recipes still load in both
cases.

## Cache and Task invalidation

Each in-process cache entry is stamped with the SHA-256 fingerprint of the
complete merged set in `skill_set_hash`. Orka includes the same hash in the
analysis contract used for Tool scope and Task identity.

The hash changes when any selected built-in or consumer recipe changes, or when
the selected profile set changes. The result is:

- Existing in-process entries with the prior hash are re-analyzed.
- Orka emits a different contract hash, Tool scope, and Task name.
- Consumer-only whitespace and YAML comment changes do not change the hash.

Changing an engine recipe therefore invalidates consumers that select that
profile. Switching from `[filesystem]` to `[filesystem, k8s]` also invalidates
prior results because the model-visible evidence contract changed.

## Writing good triggers

Triggers fire against the model's *draft* analysis, not against
artifact contents. Tune them to phrases the model actually emits
when it's diagnosing this failure pattern:

| Pattern               | Good for                                  | Risk                              |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `(?i)x509`            | webhook TLS / cert errors                 | over-fires on benign mentions     |
| `(?i)cloud-init.*empty` | empty bootstrap logs                    | narrow; misses paraphrase         |
| `(?i)leader\s+election` | KCP control-plane leader-election loss | narrow; very specific             |
| `\bquota\b`           | quota exhaustion                          | watch for "quota" used elsewhere  |

Tradeoffs:

- **Wider triggers** catch more cases but waste critique cycles on
  failures the recipe doesn't actually help with.
- **Narrower triggers** are tight but miss paraphrases the model
  might use.

Start narrow. Widen when you observe a real miss in the data; never
widen on speculation.

## Writing good evidence groups

Each group should encode "if this failure pattern is real, the
canonical artifact for it lives at one of these paths":

- Patterns are matched against the agent's successfully-read paths
  (full path, lowercase, slash-normalized). Use slash-style globs
  (e.g. `clusters/.*/machines/`).
- Use `any_of` to handle natural variation: different namespaces,
  different generated filenames, different controller pod names.
- Use `when` only when one recipe spans distinct failure classes. Its regexes
  match the same draft text as skill triggers and keep unrelated groups out of
  critique and final validation.
- Prefer 2-3 evidence groups over a single sprawling group: smaller
  groups give more precise feedback to the model.
- Keep `description` short and human-readable; the engine surfaces
  it verbatim in critique feedback.

## Dynamic retry budget

When a recipe matches and the agent has missing evidence, the
critique gate appends:

- The standard `critiqueRetryIters` budget (3 extra iterations).
- A skill-driven bonus: `1 + 2*N` extra iterations, where N is the
  total number of missing evidence groups, capped at
  `critiqueMissingEvidenceBonusCap` (6 by default).

So a recipe with 1 missing group gets `3 + 3 = 6` extra iters per
retry; a recipe with 3 missing groups gets `3 + 6 = 9` extra iters.
The cap prevents pathological recipes (10+ groups) from giving the
loop unbounded budget.

## Schema versioning

Skills don't have their own schema version. Changes to a recipe
change the SkillSetHash, which invalidates affected cache entries.
Engine-side contract changes (e.g. adding a new check inside the
critique gate) bump `currentCritiqueVersion` instead, which also
invalidates all entries on the next run.

## Authoring checklist

Before merging a new recipe:

1. **Trigger fires on a real draft.** Run `grep -i <trigger>` against
   `data/jobs/*.json` to confirm at least one analysis uses the phrase.
2. **Evidence groups match real reads.** Check the `tool_calls` of a
   matching analysis (or run a local fetch) to confirm the agent does
   fetch the artifact when prompted.
3. **Procedure is short and tool-oriented.** Quote canonical tool
   names + paths. Don't issue meta-instructions ("think carefully").
4. **`min_gcs_bytes` is high enough** that the cumulative
   tool-call budget already covers the canonical reads. Otherwise
   the agent will satisfy `min_gcs_bytes` with shallow listings and
   never reach the depth your recipe expects.
5. **Validated before promotion.** Refetch with the recipe present
   and confirm the recipe-matched cases gain evidence reads and
   substantive root-cause depth versus the prior run.

## Orka backend

The Orka producer loads the same merged set as the in-process fetcher and sends
the complete contract to the scoped `required_evidence` and `submit_analysis`
Tools. Before creating each Task, it matches a bounded failure-evidence signal without producer instructions, resolves
ranked exact artifact candidates for every applicable evidence group, and
prepends that bounded evidence plan to the Task prompt. `required_evidence`
returns the same candidate shape when the diagnosis changes or a group was not
resolved in the initial bounded tree. A complete initial plan satisfies the
recipe-lookup acceptance gate; truncated, omitted, unmatched, and no-candidate
plans retain the mandatory `required_evidence` call. The per-Task submit Tool
receives the initially applicable groups through a hidden header, so final
validation requires their evidence tokens even if the model's final wording no
longer matches the initial recipe.

The merged hash and evidence-plan hash participate in Orka Task identity. Recipe
edits, profile-selection changes, and a materially different candidate plan
therefore invalidate the affected Task. Final Orka validation checks the same
union of initially planned and final-diagnosis evidence groups and includes
candidate paths when rejecting a submission with missing evidence.

## Observability

When a recipe fires, the fetcher logs (per analysis):

```
  ✗ agentic critique: [skill:webhook-tls-failure(missing:cert-manager-config,webhook-secret)]; re-prompting (retry 1/2, +9 iters)
```

After the run, every `AIAnalysis` in `data/jobs/*.json` carries:

- `critique_passed`: did the final answer clear critique?
- `critique_version`: which engine contract version did it clear?
- `skill_set_hash`: fingerprint of the recipe set at the time.

Grouping analyses by `skill_set_hash` lets you compare runs before and after
a recipe or profile change.

## Auto-suggesting recipes

The former `ai.suggest_skills` automation was removed. Consumers still author
and review recipe files under `skills/*.yaml`; their presence is the opt-in.
There is no scheduled recipe-generation feature or `SKILL_TOKEN` secret.
