# AI providers

The dashboard's AI analysis is provider-agnostic. The fetcher speaks plain
OpenAI chat-completions over HTTPS, so anything that exposes a
`POST /chat/completions` endpoint will work: GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, Azure
OpenAI, Nvidia Dynamo / NIMs, vLLM, Ollama, or a self-hosted proxy.

Configure your provider in your consumer repo's `project.yaml` under `ai:`:

```yaml
ai:
  endpoint: "..."         # Optional. Chat-completions URL. Defaults to Copilot.
  model: "..."            # Optional. Model identifier the endpoint expects.
  headers:                # Optional. Extra HTTP headers merged into every call.
    Some-Header: "value"
```

Set the bearer token via the `AI_TOKEN` secret in the GitHub Actions workflow
(see the [reusable workflow README](../README.md)). The token is sent as
`Authorization: Bearer <AI_TOKEN>` unless an entry in `headers:` overrides it.

### Hiding the model identifier and endpoint URL from the public repo

`project.yaml` is committed to a public repo, so any value you put in
`endpoint:` or `model:` is visible to the world. That's fine for public
providers and standard model names, but it's a problem when:

- The model identifier is one you would rather not commit to a public file
  (a preview label, or a model only your org is enrolled in).
- The endpoint is a private gateway URL you don't want indexed.

For those cases, leave `endpoint:` and `model:` out of `project.yaml` and
pass them through repo-scoped GitHub Actions **variables** (not secrets;
these aren't sensitive enough to need masking). The reusable workflow
accepts `ai-model` and `ai-endpoint` inputs and forwards them to the
fetcher as `AI_MODEL` / `AI_ENDPOINT` env vars; the fetcher reads those
when the yaml fields are blank.

```yaml
# In the consumer repo's project.yaml
ai:
  # endpoint and model intentionally omitted; supplied via repo
  # variables on the consumer (see the deploy workflow).
```

```yaml
# In the consumer's .github/workflows/deploy.yml
jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: willie-yao/prow-ai-dashboard/.github/workflows/reusable-deploy.yml@main
    with:
      project_dir: .
      ai-model: ${{ vars.AI_MODEL }}
      ai-endpoint: ${{ vars.AI_ENDPOINT }}
    secrets:
      AI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.AI_TOKEN }}
```

Set the variables once per consumer repo:

```sh
gh variable set AI_MODEL    --repo your-org/your-consumer-repo
gh variable set AI_ENDPOINT --repo your-org/your-consumer-repo
```

Resolution order is `project.yaml` field > env var > engine default, so
yaml entries still win if you ever need to override per-repo. Sourcing
the inputs from `vars.*` (instead of hardcoding in the workflow file)
keeps the values out of the public repo source.

The engine also scrubs `ai.endpoint`, `ai.model`, and per-failure
`ai_analysis.model` from every JSON file written to `frontend/public/data/`
regardless of where the values came from, so private model labels never
reach the deployed GitHub Pages site even if a future change accidentally
puts them back in yaml.

## GitHub Copilot (default endpoint)

Leave `endpoint` unset to target Copilot. `AI_TOKEN` is a fine-grained PAT
with the `copilot_chat` user permission. Set `model` explicitly to a model
your Copilot plan exposes; a public model id keeps the config reproducible
for anyone reading the repo:

```yaml
ai:
  endpoint: "https://api.githubcopilot.com/chat/completions"
  model: "gpt-4o"
```

Copilot is metered, not free: it requires a subscription, and a full cold
fetch (one agentic investigation per failure) consumes request and token
allowance. The free individual tier works for trying it out but has a limited
monthly allowance; organizations need paid licenses. Pick a model whose
context window comfortably fits a debugging prompt (most current Copilot models
offer 128K or more). If you leave `model` unset the engine falls back to a
built-in default, so set it explicitly to keep the config self-describing.

The fetcher automatically sends `Copilot-Integration-Id: copilot-developer-cli`
when (and only when) the endpoint's host is `*.githubcopilot.com`.

## OpenAI

```yaml
ai:
  endpoint: "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
  model: "gpt-4o"
```

`AI_TOKEN` is your OpenAI API key.

## Azure OpenAI

Azure OpenAI uses a per-deployment URL and an `api-key` header instead of
`Authorization: Bearer`. Put the key in the `headers:` map so it replaces
the default bearer scheme:

```yaml
ai:
  endpoint: "https://my-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-4o/chat/completions?api-version=2024-08-01-preview"
  model: "gpt-4o"
  headers:
    api-key: "${AI_TOKEN}"
```

Note: `${AI_TOKEN}` interpolation isn't built in. Either inject the literal
value via a workflow `env:` step or set the header directly in the YAML
(only safe for non-secret routing values).

## Nvidia Dynamo / NIM

NIMs accept the OpenAI schema. Use the model name your NIM exposes:

```yaml
ai:
  endpoint: "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions"
  model: "meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct"
```

`AI_TOKEN` is your NVIDIA API key. For self-hosted NIMs, point `endpoint` at
your cluster's gateway and add any routing headers your gateway expects.

## vLLM / Ollama / self-hosted

Any OpenAI-compatible server works. For Ollama:

```yaml
ai:
  endpoint: "http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions"
  model: "llama3.1"
```

Self-hosted endpoints typically don't require a token; set `AI_TOKEN` to any
non-empty placeholder in your workflow so the env check in the fetcher passes.

## Cache invalidation when switching providers

Cache keys are content-based (hash of the test name + normalized failure
message) and do not include the model or endpoint. Switching providers will
return stale cached responses from the previous model until the cache is
cleared. Run the project's `clear-cache.yml` workflow after changing
`endpoint` or `model` if you want fresh analyses.

Switching providers does NOT change the analysis mode: the engine always
runs the agentic loop. Cached entries simply re-analyze when the cached
`mode` no longer matches, which self-heals over one fetcher run.

## Function-calling support (required)

The engine sends an OpenAI-style `tools` field on every request and expects
`tool_calls` back from the model. There is no tools-free fallback: the first
agentic call to an endpoint that returns HTTP 400/422 with a tools-related
error is treated as a capability miss, and every failure that run surfaces as
an "AI analysis unavailable" summary (the fetcher logs `AI endpoint rejected
tools`). Verified endpoints: GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and
tool-calling Ollama / NIM models (per-model).

## Cost and latency notes

Each non-transient failure triggers one agentic investigation (a sequence of
chat-completion calls). Roughly 50-150k input tokens and 30-90 seconds of
wall clock per failure, depending on artifact size and how deep the model
digs. Most providers price the input dominant. See
[agentic.md](agentic.md) for cost-control knobs (`max_iters`, `concurrency`).
